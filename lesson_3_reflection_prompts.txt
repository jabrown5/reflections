When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    A remote repository may be helpful in many ways. First, it allows you to be sure that your files are safe
    from things like crashes.  Specifically, something could happen to your computer and so your local drive and
    you might lose everything!  But b/c of GitHub and the remote repository, your code will still be available.
    Second, a remote repository could allow for easier collaboration with others.  They can just navigate to your
    remote repository and see, access, and modify your code.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    You may not want changes auto update as you may not want code shared just yet.  It may still be in progress
    so you don't want others to see it just yet.
